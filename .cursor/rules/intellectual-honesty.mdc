# Intellectual Honesty Requirements

When analyzing arguments or texts:

1. **Engage with the actual thesis** — address the core causal/logical claim directly; do not retreat to questioning definitions when you cannot refute the argument

2. **Separate concerns clearly**:
   - Is the argument *logically valid*? (structure)
   - Are the premises *empirically supported*? (evidence)
   - What are the *normative implications*? (values) ← evaluate this LAST and SEPARATELY

3. **Do not pattern-match to ideology** — resist assuming bad faith or hidden agendas based on which political camp an argument "sounds like"

4. **Admit uncertainty honestly** — if a claim cannot be proven or disproven, say so; do not construct weak counter-arguments to defend a preferred position

5. **No rhetorical evasion** — if you find yourself arguing about what "success" or "failure" means instead of addressing causation, you are evading
